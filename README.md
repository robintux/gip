# Gentle Introduction to Programming

This is the website for a course given in School of Computer Science of Tel-Aviv University.
It is offered to Computer Science students before they start their 1st undergraduate year.
The goal of the course is to bridge the gap between students with and without programming experience.
The course provides a a gentle introduction and a basic background in the Python programming language, 
as the first academic course in which the students will learn programming is [Extended Intro to CS](http://tau-cs1001-py.wikidot.com/) which is given in Python.

## Technicalities

The course has 5x3 hour lectures and 2x2 hour hands-on recitations (in a computer lab). 
In addition, at the end of each lecture a guest speaker (faculty, grad student or from the industry) is invited to talk about Computer Science and Software, 
to give the students a broad idea of what is Computer Science and Software Engineering.
