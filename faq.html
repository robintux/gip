          Go to system-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Keyboard,
          add language (Hebrew), and select in the "Layout" operation keys.

            I am enrolled for a combined program of engineering with computer science (CS), 
I heard that there are basic courses for CS and for engineering-students which one is more appropriate for me?

            For students from combined-programs we recommend the CS course: 
the course's level is higher, and there are interesting guest talks given by faculty members.

            No. This course is designated for incoming
students with little or no prior experience in programming. It is not
obligatory, but recommended for such students.

            No. This course does not have a grade and is not
"worth" academic points.

            <td>
            Hearing the official session is not enough! This
course is quite intensive for students without prior knowledge - in
three weeks you will learn a lot of material. Thus, in order to fully
understand you will have to use the time between the sessions to
program and exercise what was taught. Practical exercises will be
published after every session, it is not obligatory to complete them,
but it is highly recommended.
